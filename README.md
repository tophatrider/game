# Top Hat Rider

A modern revival of the classic browser game once known as *Black Hat Rider*.  
The original game has been lost to time, but thanks to a preserved copy of the source code, this reimagined version is being rebuilt from the ground up with contemporary web technologies and development patterns.

This project is not just a restoration â€” it's a complete evolution.

## About the Game

Top Hat Rider is a physics-based side-scrolling game where the player controls a rider navigating dynamic terrain. Precision, timing, and smooth motion are at the heart of the experience.

Originally built with early JavaScript practices, the new version aims to be performant, maintainable, and extensible using modern approaches.

## Modern Enhancements and Changes

### Architectural Improvements

- Rewritten using modular, component-based JavaScript (ES6+)
- Isolated rendering via **Web Workers**, offloading draw logic from the main thread
- Game logic and rendering are sandboxed for better performance and security

### Graphics and Rendering

- Use of **Shadow DOM** and **Constructable Stylesheets** for scoped UI styling
- Canvas-based rendering with separation of UI and game loop
- Responsive design considerations for modern screens

### Gameplay & Physics

- **Linear interpolation** (lerp) implemented for smoother motion and animation transitions
- Frame-independent physics updates using `requestAnimationFrame` and time delta calculations
- Future-ready for mobile touch support and gamepad input

### Codebase and Tooling

- Clear file structure for game engine, rendering, assets, and utilities
- Scalable design for future features like multiplayer
